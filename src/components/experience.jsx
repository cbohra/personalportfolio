    <h3>Client: Capital One – Boston, MA</h3>
    <p>
      I'm in charge of creating and improving the End-User Computing Tool
      (EUCT). This involves designing how the tool looks and works for users
      (using technologies like JavaScript and Angular), as well as handling the
      behind-the-scenes stuff like managing data and ensuring security.

    <h3>Wells Fargo – New York, NY</h3>

    <p>
      My responsibility was to develop Java applications for their systems. This
      involved working closely with a team in an Agile environment, where we had
      daily check-ins and planned our work in sprints. I was also responsible
      for documenting technical specifications and user guides to help others
      understand our work.
